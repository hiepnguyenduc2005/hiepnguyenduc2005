# Introduction
👋 Hi everyone, I am Hiep (Roger) Nguyen, an honors freshman in Computer Science at Villanova University. I am also exploring a double major in Economics and a concentration in Cognitive Science, underlining my enthusiasm for the intersection of technology, economics, and human cognition.

🌱In addition to attending every rigorous course, hackathon, project-based program, and programming competition I can find, I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks for side projects. I am currently building most frequently with: Python, HTML, and CSS. 

💞️ My deep-rooted interest in Education propels my vision: applying Cognitive AI in behavioral economics or personalized STEM Education. My long-term goal is to develop an ecosystem where Vietnamese children can access personalized learning with high-quality and zero-cost science resources.

My name is Martin Heinz and I'm a software developer/DevOps engineer. I'm from Slovakia, living in Bratislava and currently working at IBM. You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1],  or on [![LinkedIn][3.2]][3].
